          <h1>Project Launch</h1>
          <p>Together with students from <a class='p' href="https://kisd.de/">KISD</a> and the inclusion expert Un-Label
            e.V., we have developed an initial partial solution for people with the disabilities of understanding and
            moving.
            The prototype, which was developed as part of an iterative process, presents accessible offers for people
            with Down syndrome and people in wheelchairs in a comprehensible way.</p>

          <h1>AI for Hand-written Digit Recognition</h1>
          <p><a href="https://students.pages.coco.study/ss22/aai/team-1/digit_recognition/">Here</a> you find a simple
            digit recognition program built using TensorFlow.js and P5.js. It allows users to draw a digit from 0 to 9
            or letter from latin alphabet on a canvas using their mouse. The program then uses a neural network model,
            specifically a single-layer perceptron to recognize the drawn digit and display the predicted number. The
            perceptron is a fundamental type of neural network known for its simplicity and early contributions to the
            field of machine learning.
            The neural network model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a large collection of hand-drawn digits. The MNIST
            dataset consists of 28x28 pixel images, each representing a single digit from 0 to 9. By training the neural
            network on this dataset, it learns to recognize patterns and features that distinguish each digit. For
            letters program have no data set, but users can train the model themselves by clicking on the corresponding
            buttons for each digit.
            Also we see a weight module in interface. It displays the weights associated with each digit as a 28x28 grid
            of squares on a canvas. The shade of each square corresponds to the magnitude of the weight, where lighter
            shades represent higher weights and darker shades represent lower weights. This dynamic visualization allows
            users to observe how the model learns to recognize different patterns for each digit during the training
            process.</p>

          <p>In this project
            <!-- ... <object data="images/Kintsugi.pdf" width="500" height="200"></object>-->
            under the theme "Hyperlinked Originals" at the <a class='p' href="https://kisd.de/">KISD</a> , I connected a
            Samsung PL210 digital camera by cable to an EPSON XP 7100 printer. The context of media archaeology examines the media of the past in terms of their influence in a society.
            By using the photo of a camera with a broken display, I emphasize that older media is considered just as beautiful as newer media or technology and one should use it fiercely and
            proudly rather than storing e-appliances without ever using them anymore.</p>

          <h1>Project Make</h1>
          <p>In this project, we created a concept for a social media campaign about the German care sector. The aim is
            to generate enthusiasm and to raise awareness for the day to day and structural problems that nurses deal
            with. We have drawn upon the means of a social media campaign in order to reach the broad masses as well as
            our target groups Gen Z and millennials.
