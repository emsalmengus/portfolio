            <h1>Project Launch</h1>
            <p>Together with students from KISD and the inclusion expert Un-Label e.V., we have developed an initial partial solution for people with the disabilities of understanding and moving.
              The prototype, which was developed as part of an iterative process, presents accessible offers for people with Down syndrome and people in wheelchairs in a comprehensible way.</p>

              under the theme "Hyperlinked Originals", I connected a Samsung PL210 digital camera by cable to an EPSON XP 7100 printer. I have simulated that a photo of an object is taken by the digital camera. The LCD display of the camera is damaged, which becomes clear by the cracks in the display. Firstly, a flash fires visualizing the photo shooting process. In the end, the photo is printed by the printer. When taking a closer look at the printed photo, one can see the cracks in the display were also printed on the photo.</p>

            <h1>Project Make</h1>
            <p>In this project, we created a concept for a social media campaign about the German care sector. The aim is to generate enthusiasm and to raise awareness for the day to day and structural problems that nurses deal with. We have drawn upon the means of a social media campaign in order to reach the broad masses as well as our target groups Gen Z and millennials.

            <h1>AI for Hand-written Digit Recognition</h1>
            <p><a href="https://students.pages.coco.study/ss22/aai/team-1/digit_recognition/">Here</a> you find a simple digit recognition program built using TensorFlow.js and P5.js. It allows users to draw a digit from 0 to 9 or letter from latin alphabet on a canvas using their mouse. The program then uses a neural network model, specifically a single-layer perceptron to recognize the drawn digit and display the predicted number. The perceptron is a fundamental type of neural network known for its simplicity and early contributions to the field of machine learning. 
              The neural network model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a large collection of hand-drawn digits. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel images, each representing a single digit from 0 to 9. By training the neural network on this dataset, it learns to recognize patterns and features that distinguish each digit. For letters program have no data set, but users can train the model themselves by clicking on the corresponding buttons for each digit.  
              Also we see a weight module in interface. It displays the weights associated with each digit as a 28x28 grid of squares on a canvas. The shade of each square corresponds to the magnitude of the weight, where lighter shades represent higher weights and darker shades represent lower weights. This dynamic visualization allows users to observe how the model learns to recognize different patterns for each digit during the training process.</p>
