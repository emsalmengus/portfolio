        <h1>Interneting Is Easyy!</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
            headings.</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>This is how you make an unordered list.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Add ul element (unordered list).</li>
            <li>Add each ite in its own li element</li>
            <li>They do not need to be in any order.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is how you make an ordered list.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Add ul element (unordered list).</li>
            <li>Add each ite in its own li element</li>
            <li>They do not need to be in any order.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
        <p><em>Sometimes,</em> you want to emphasize a certain word.</p>
        <p>Other times, you want to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
        <p><em><strong>And sometimes, you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

        <h3>Empty Elements</h3>

        <p>Best regards,
        <br/>
        The authors</p>

        <p>PS: This page might look like crap, but we'll learn how to fix that with some CSS soon.</p>
